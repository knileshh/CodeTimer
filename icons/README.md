# Icon Placeholder Files
# These should be replaced with actual PNG icons generated from icon.svg
# 
# To generate PNG icons from the SVG:
# 1. Open icon.svg in a vector graphics editor (Inkscape, Illustrator, etc.)
# 2. Export as PNG with the following sizes:
#    - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
#    - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
#    - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
#    - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
#
# For now, these placeholder files ensure the manifest doesn't break
# The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience
